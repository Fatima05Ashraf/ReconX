**ReconX**

ReconX is a simple WHOIS & DNS reconnaissance tool I built for practice.  
It automates basic recon steps like WHOIS lookup, DNS records extraction, and also has a **Streamlit-based interface** for a smoother experience.  



**Features**
- WHOIS lookup for domain info  
- DNS records collection (A, MX, NS, TXT, etc.)  
- Saves results into CSV and JSON files  
- **Streamlit web interface** for easy interaction  
- Optional GUI with Python  



**Usage**
Run from Terminal :-
_python src/recon_tool.py_

Run with CLI :-
_python main.py -d example.com_

Run with GUI :-
__python gui.py_

Run with Streamlit :-
__streamlit run gui.py_


**Notes**

- This project was done mainly for learning & practice purposes.

- It’s not meant for illegal use — only for ethical testing and research.

- Streamlit makes it easier to test from a browser instead of only command-line.
